# Exercices with GATE


Simulations are organized in a folder, with the following subfolders : ```data```, ```mac``` and ```output```. Macros files are stored in ```mac```. Gate *must* be run in the initial simulation folder, such as : ```Gate mac/main.mac``` (don't forget the ```mac/```). The macros that make use of data *must* refer to the ```data/``` subfolder.

Documentation can be found at : http://wiki.opengatecollaboration.org/index.php/Users_Guide_V7.2

Follow the following exercises and provide a written report. The general idea it to try to understand every commands in the macro files to be able to analyze the results.
