# Exercise3 - Proton

Modify the beam to shoot 100 MeV proton instead of gamma \(`ex3.mac`\). Note that the physic-list has been changed. More information on the physic lists can be obtained:

* [http://geant4.cern.ch/support/proc\_mod\_catalog/physics\_lists/useCases.shtml](http://geant4.cern.ch/support/proc_mod_catalog/physics_lists/useCases.shtml)
* [http://wiki.opengatecollaboration.org/index.php/Users\_Guide:Setting\_up\_the\_physics](http://wiki.opengatecollaboration.org/index.php/Users_Guide:Setting_up_the_physics)

Observe the computation time, the numbers of track/steps and the uncertainty. What are the differences with photon beam ? Again, you can use Python to plot the deposited energy as a function of the depth and obtain the Bragg peak.

Add a dense volume in the path of the proton to observe the effects.
