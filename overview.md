# Overview

## Exercices about dose

* Exercice 1: photon beam, dose in water, 2D
* Exercice 2: photon beam, 3D dose map in 3D CT image
* Exercice 3: proton beam
* Exercice 4: simulation of a LINAC, phase-space concept
* Exercice 5: internal radiation therapy \(dosimetry\)

## Exercices about imaging

* Exercice 6: SPECT imaging

## Exercices about Variance Reduction Techniques \(VRT\)

* Exercice 7: Track Length Estimator, dose for low energy photon \(&lt;1 MeV\)
* Exercice 8: ConeBeam CT imaging with Fixed Forced Detection technique
