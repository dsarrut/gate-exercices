### Step 1

We now consider the simulation of internal radiation therapy treatment with an agent labelled with Yttrium 90. 90Y emits a continuous spectrum of electron with a mean energy aroun 927 keV and a maximum at 2.28 MeV. Several SPECT images have been merged together to produce a time-integrated activity emission map (TIA) associated with a patient CT. Consider the simulation that uses this TIA as a voxelized source, see macros ```main.mac``` and ```source-vox.mac```. The pixels in the TIA image are expressed in MBq.h. 

Perform a simulation, analyze the results.

### Step 2

Create from scratch a simple simulation that allow you to get the Energy spectrum of the Yttrium-90 in water. 

### Step 3

Change the voxelized source to a simple ponctual source in the middle of the patient. Then, change the radionuclide, for example by using Lutetium-177 or Iode-131 or any radionuclides you like in http://www.nucleide.org/DDEP_WG/DDEPdata.htm.

What are the differences in absorbed dose according to the radionuclides ?
