We now consider the simulation of internal radiation therapy treatment with an agent labelled with Yttrium 90. 90Y emits a continuous spectrum of electron with a mean energy aroun 927 keV and a maximum at 2.28 MeV. Several SPECT images have been merged together to produce a time-integrated activity emission map (TIA) associated with a patient CT. Consider the simulation that uses this TIA as a voxelized source, see macros ```main.mac``` and ```source-vox.mac```. The pixels in the TIA image are expressed in MBq.h. 

Perform a simulation, analyze the results.
