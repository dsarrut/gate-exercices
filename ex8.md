# Exercise 8

We now want to simulate a brachytherapy treatment. This is a two steps process. The first step consists in determining the characteristic of a 125I source. The second step uses this source inside a patient image. Look, run and describe the simulations from the main macro: ```main.mac``` (step1) and ```mainReadPhs.mac``` (step2) in the ```brachytherapy``` folder.
