# Exercise 8 (SPECT)

(need release v2.2)

In the folder `spect` you will find a simplified simulation of a SPECT acquisition. Warning: this simulation need a very long computation time to reach acceptable statistic. Some variance reduction techniques exist, but are not shown here. 

This is a rather complex simulation. Try to understand every elements (in particular in spect_head, spect_collimator, spect_digitizer).

You may change the phantom (just a waterbox here) by a ct image for example. You may change the source to observe the impact.
